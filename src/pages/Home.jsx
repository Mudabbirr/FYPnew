                        <p id='std'>â€˜I started by searching on Google for courses that suites my interest and I was redirected to different websites, one of which is Edugate.com which turned out to be the most useful. I chose Vytautas Magnus University because it was the most affordable for me and the course completely suited my needs. Studyportals helped by giving me a wide range of detailed options of schools and courses to choose from. I did not have an idea of either the course or the university I wanted to attend. At the initial stage, before the application, I received all the necessary information about the course and school, through a direct website link to the course.</p>
